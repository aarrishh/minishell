Redirections
echo hello > file (we have leak)
cat < file (we have leak)
cat << EOF then type input (heredoc) (not done yet)
ls >> file (append redirection) (we have leak) 
nosuchcommand > out (failed command with redirect) (we have leak when running exit)
ðŸ‘‰ Redirections allocate filenames, open fds, and can leave leaks if not freed.
